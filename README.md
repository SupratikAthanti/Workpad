# The WorkPad

A 3x3 macropad made with the help of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)'s [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com) program.\
There are 8 keys that are backlit with LEDs, a rotary encoder, an OLED screen, and a XIAO RP2040 as the microcontroller.


## CAD

The case fits together using four M3 bolts and four M3 heatset inserts.\
The case is made of three separate printed pieces.\

## Firmware

This macropad uses [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/) for firmware.

- Rotary encoder knob adjusts the volume.
- By default, each key is bound to type out a number. The keys can type out the numbers 1 through 9. (There aren't enough keys to type out the number 0)
- This macropad is compatible with [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/), so that it can actually macro.
- The OLED screen should play the animation below at all times\

  - Still playing with the idea of displaying useful information.
